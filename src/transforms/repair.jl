    Repair{K}

Perform repairing operation with code `K`.

## Available operations

- K = 0: duplicated vertices and faces are removed
- K = 1: unused vertices are removed
- K = 2: non-manifold faces are removed
- K = 3: degenerate faces are removed
- K = 4: non-manifold vertices are removed
- K = 5: non-manifold vertices are split by threshold
- K = 6: close vertices are merged (given a radius)
- K = 7: faces are coherently oriented
