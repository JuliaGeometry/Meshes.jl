An intersection between geometries holding a geometry of type `G`.
"""

"""

Return the type of intersection computed between geometries.

Return the underlying geometry stored in the intersection object.

"""
    g₁ ∩ g₂

Return the intersection of two geometries or domains `g₁` and `g₂`
as a new (multi-)geometry.
"""
Base.intersect(g₁::GeometryOrDomain, g₂::GeometryOrDomain) = get(intersection(g₁, g₂))

"""
    intersection([f], g₁, g₂)

Compute the intersection of two geometries or domains `g₁` and `g₂`
and apply function `f` to it. Default function is `identity`.

## Examples

```julia
intersection(g₁, g₂) do I
  if I isa CrossingLines
    # do something
  else
    # do nothing
  end
end
```

### Notes

When a custom function `f` is used that reduces the number of
return types, Julia is able to optimize the branches of the code
and generate specialized code. This is not the case when
`f === identity`.
"""
intersection(f, g₁, g₂) = intersection(f, g₂, g₁)
intersection(g₁, g₂) = intersection(identity, g₁, g₂)
