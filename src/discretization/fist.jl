    FIST

Fast Industrial-Strength Triangulation (FIST) of polygons.

This triangulation method is the method behind the famous Mapbox's
Earcut library. It is based on a ear clipping algorithm adapted
for complex n-gons with holes. It has O(nÂ²) time complexity where
n is the number of vertices. In practice it is very efficient due
to heuristics implemented in the algorithm.
