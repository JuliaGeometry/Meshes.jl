    Primitive{Dim,T}

We say that a geometry is a primitive when it can be expressed as a single
entity with no parts (a.k.a. atomic). For example, a sphere is a primitive
described in terms of a mathematical expression involving a metric and a radius.

# POLYTOPES

"""
    Polytope{N,Dim,T}

We say that a geometry is a N-polytope when it is a collection of "flat" sides that constitue a N-dimensional subspace.
They are called polygon and polyhedron respectively for 2D (N=2) and 3D (N=3) subspaces, embedded in a `Dim`-dimensional space.
The term polytope expresses a particular combinatorial structure. A polyhedron, for example, can be decomposed into faces. Each face can then be decomposed into edges, and edges into vertices.
Some conventions act as a mapping between vertices and higher dimensional features (edges, faces, cells...), removing the need to store all features. We follow the [ordering conventions](https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#Node-ordering) of the GMSH project.

Additionally, the following property must hold in order for a geometry to be considered
a polytope: the boundary of a (n+1)-polytope is a collection of n-polytopes, which may
have (n-1)-polytopes in common. For more information, see the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope) page.

    Face{N, Dim,T}

We say that a polytope is a face when it can be used as an element in a finite element
mesh (e.g. segments, triangles, tetrahedrons). The rank of the face reflects the actual
parametric dimension of the polytope. For example, a segment is a 1-face, a triangle is a
2-face and a tetrahedron is a 3-face. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_polytope.
