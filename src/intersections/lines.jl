The intersection type can be one of three types:

1. intersect at one point
2. overlap at more than one point
3. do not overlap nor intersect

    intersectparameters(a, b, c, d)

Compute the parameters `λ₁` and `λ₂` of the lines 
`a + λ₁ ⋅ v⃗₁`, with ` v⃗₁ = b - a` and
`c + λ₂ ⋅ v⃗₂`, with ` v⃗₂ = d - c`
spanned by the input points `a`, `b` resp. `c`, `d`
such that to yield line points with minimal distance 
or the intersection point (if lines intersect).

Furthermore the ranks `r` of the matrix of the linear system 
`A ⋅ λ⃗ = y⃗`, with `A = [v⃗₁ -v⃗₂], y⃗ = c - a`
and the rank `rₐ` of the augmented matrix `[A y⃗]` are calculated in order to 
identify the intersection type:

- Intersection: r == rₐ == 2
- Collinear: r == rₐ == 1
- No intersection: r != rₐ
  - No intersection and parallel:  r == 1, rₐ == 2
  - No intersection, skew lines: r == 2, rₐ == 3
