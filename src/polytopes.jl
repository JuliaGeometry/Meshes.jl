    Polytope{K,M,CRS}

We say that a geometry is a K-polytope when it is a collection of "flat" sides
that constitute a `K`-dimensional subspace. They are called chain, polygon and
polyhedron respectively for 1D (`K=1`), 2D (`K=2`) and 3D (`K=3`) subspaces.
The parameter `K` is also known as the rank or parametric dimension 
of the polytope (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_polytope>).

The term polytope expresses a particular combinatorial structure. A polyhedron,
for example, can be decomposed into faces. Each face can then be decomposed into
edges, and edges into vertices. Some conventions act as a mapping between vertices
and higher dimensional features (edges, faces, cells...), removing the need to
store all features.

Additionally, the following property must hold in order for a geometry to be considered
a polytope: the boundary of a (K+1)-polytope is a collection of K-polytopes, which may
have (K-1)-polytopes in common. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope>.

### Notes

- Type aliases are `Chain`, `Polygon`, `Polyhedron`.
