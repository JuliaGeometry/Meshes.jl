## Discrete sampling

### UniformSampling

```@docs
UniformSampling
```

```@example sampling
grid = CartesianGrid(20, 20)

# uniform sampling without replacement
sampler = UniformSampling(100, replace=false)
blocks  = sample(grid, sampler)

viz(blocks)
```

### WeightedSampling

```@docs
WeightedSampling
```

```@example sampling
grid = CartesianGrid(20, 20)

# upper blocks are 10x more likely
weights = [fill(1, 200); fill(10, 200)]

# weighted sampling without replacement
sampler = WeightedSampling(100, weights, replace=false)
blocks  = sample(grid, sampler)

viz(blocks)
```

### BallSampling

```@docs
BallSampling
```

```@example sampling
grid = CartesianGrid(20, 20)

# sample blocks that are apart by a given radius
sampler = BallSampling(5.0)
blocks  = sample(grid, sampler)

viz(blocks)
```

## Continuous sampling

### RegularSampling

```@docs
RegularSampling
```

```@example sampling
grid = CartesianGrid(20, 20)

# sample points regularly
sampler = RegularSampling(20, 30)
points  = sample(grid, sampler) |> collect

viz(points)
```

### HomogeneousSampling

```@docs
HomogeneousSampling
```

```@example sampling
grid = CartesianGrid(20, 20)

# sample points homogeneously
sampler = HomogeneousSampling(100)
points  = sample(grid, sampler) |> collect

viz(points)
```

### MinDistanceSampling

```@docs
MinDistanceSampling
```

```@example sampling
grid = CartesianGrid(20, 20)

# sample points that are apart by a given radius
sampler = MinDistanceSampling(3.0)
points  = sample(grid, sampler) |> collect

viz(points)
```
