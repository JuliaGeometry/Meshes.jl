# Meshes

```@example meshes
using Meshes # hide
import CairoMakie as Mke # hide
```

Meshes can be constructed directly (e.g. [`CartesianGrid`](@ref)) or based on other
constructs such as connectivity lists and topological structures (e.g. [`SimpleMesh`](@ref)).

## Overview

```@docs
Mesh
Grid
```

```@docs
CartesianGrid
```

```@example meshes
# 3D Cartesian grid
grid = CartesianGrid(10, 10, 10)

viz(grid, showsegments = true)
```

```@docs
RectilinearGrid
```

```@example meshes
# 2D rectilinear grid
x = 0.0:0.2:1.0
y = [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0]
grid = RectilinearGrid(x, y)

viz(grid, showsegments = true)
```

```@docs
StructuredGrid
```

```@example meshes
# 2D structured grid
X = [i/20 * cos(3œÄ/2 * (j-1) / (30-1)) for i in 1:20, j in 1:30]
Y = [i/20 * sin(3œÄ/2 * (j-1) / (30-1)) for i in 1:20, j in 1:30]
grid = StructuredGrid(X, Y)

viz(grid, showsegments = true)
```

```@docs
SimpleMesh
```

```@example meshes
# global vector of 2D points
points = [(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(0.25,0.5),(0.75,0.5)]

# connect the points into N-gon
connec = connect.([(1,2,6,5),(2,4,6),(4,3,5,6),(3,1,5)], Ngon)

# 2D mesh made of N-gon elements
mesh = SimpleMesh(points, connec)

viz(mesh, showsegments = true)
```

## Connectivities

```@docs
Connectivity
connect
materialize
```

## Topology

```@docs
Topology
GridTopology
HalfEdgeTopology
SimpleTopology
```

## Relations

```@docs
TopologicalRelation
Boundary
Coboundary
Adjacency
```

### Examples

```@example meshes
# global vector of 2D points
points = [(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(0.25,0.5),(0.75,0.5)]

# connect the points into N-gon
connec = connect.([(1,2,6,5),(2,4,6),(4,3,5,6),(3,1,5)], Ngon)

# 2D mesh made of N-gon elements
mesh = SimpleMesh(points, connec)
```

```@example meshes
# convert topology to half-edge topology
topo = convert(HalfEdgeTopology, topology(mesh))

# boundary relation from faces (dim=2) to edges (dim=1)
‚àÇ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ = Boundary{2,1}(topo)

# show boundary of first n-gon
‚àÇ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ(1)
```

```@example meshes
# co-boundary relation from edges (dim=1) to faces(dim=2)
ùíû‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ = Coboundary{1,2}(topo)

# show n-gons that share edge 3
ùíû‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ(3)
```
